# Data Analytics Consulting Virtual Internship
In this repository, I have included all my work related to the tasks of [Data Analytics Consulting Virtual Internship](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/theme/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c/KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship) by KPMG.

The intership consists of 3 tasks:
* Data Quality Assessment: assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis
* Data Insights: targeting high values customers based on customer demographics and attributes
* Data Insights and Presentation: using visualizations to present insights

Background:
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories has contacted KPMG to help with its customer and transactions data. The organization has a large dataset relating to its customers, but is unsure how to effectively analyze it to optimize its marketing strategy. The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
* Customer Demographic
* Customer Address
* Transactions data in the past year

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
  An [email draft](https://github.com/yeegorski/KPMG_virtual_intership/blob/main/Task%201.%20Data%20Quality%20Assessment.md) to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues.
